The events status for stage races and one-day races are allocated to each event annually by the UCI on the basis of the commissaires race report from the preceding year and any other information at disposal of the UCI. A new event may only be given class 2 or 3 status in its first year. HC status can only be given with the following cumulative conditions: Allée Ferdi Kübler 12 T: +41 24 468 58 11 Page 3 / 50 1860 Aigle E: admin@uci.ch Switzerland - event registered for at least the last three years as C1 on the UCI International Calendar; - a separate under 23 race registered for both genders for XCO; - at least eight riders from the top 50 of the UCI ranking for both gender; - at least ten nations represented in the last edition of the event; - a high level tv production for the Elite categories taking into account the sporting aspect. Under exceptional circumstances and justified reasons related to development, the UCI can grant derogations awarding HC status to events which do not meet the criteria above. A detailed technical guide for HC events, stage races and new events must be presented to UCI during the calendar registration process. A template for such technical guide is provided by UCI upon request. All events registered on the UCI international calendar must respect the UCI financial obligations (in particular calendar fee, prize money) approved by the UCI and published on the UCI website. Race entry fees, including uplift facilities for downhill and enduro, for events on the international calendar are waived for any rider belonging to a UCI MTB WORLD SERIES TEAM. This applies only to the format in which the team has UCI MTB WORLD SERIES TEAM status and does not apply to stage races, eliminator and enduro events.
